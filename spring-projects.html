        <h3><span id="1"></span>Application of Machine Learning to Analyze Molecular Dynamics Simulations</h3>
        <p>We are currently developing machine learning methods to predict the thermodynamicproperties of interfaces in
        liquid-phase environments. Our datasets consist of hundredsof thousands of atomic positions obtained from classical
        molecular dynamics (MD)simulations. An MD simulation predicts the motion of atoms and molecules at molecularlength and
        timescales (nm and ps respectively). Typically, simulation data are analyzedusing techniques based on statistical
        mechanics, but we have demonstrated thatmachine learning can drastically reduce the simulation time required to
        makepredictions of one particular thermodynamic property that is critical for predictinginterfacial hydrophobicity – the
        hydration free energy - which is relevant to the design ofbiological materials. In our present work, we have used
        LeNet5, a 2D convolutionalneural network architecture developed by LeCun et al. The project would involve usingalready
        curated datasets and testing the effect of different machine learning algorithmson prediction accuracy. Students are
        also free to extend the scope of the project and tryother machine learning models, such as 3-D CNNs or graph neural
        networks, whichwould require modification of the input data representation.</p>

        <h3><span id="2"></span>Exploring the neural basis of consciousness</h3>
        <p>We seek to identify changes in brain activity and connectivity that underlie changes inarousal state using imaging and
        electrophysiology data recorded from neurosurgicalpatients. In this project, students will use machine learning tools to
        track the dynamicsof brain network configuration with the goals of (a) identifying subsets of network
        configurations that associate with specific arousal states (wake, sleep, anesthesia), (b)building Markov models to
        identify and quantify state transitions, (c) developing analgorithm to predict arousal state in real-time, and (d)
        developing and applyingmatrix-completion algorithms to facilitate summarizing data across subjects.</p>

        <h3><span id="3"></span>Building an automated machine learning algorithm forcharacterization of anxiety-related vocalizations in non-human primates</h3>
        <p>Anxiety disorders (ADs) are among the most common psychiatric illnesses in the worldand cause significant psychosocial,
        emotional, and physical distress. ADs typicallyemerge early in childhood and follow a chronic course. A primary interest
        of the KalinLab is to characterize the neurodevelopmental origins of anxiety, both in human andmonkey models. Due to
        their extensive behavioral and neuroanatomical similarities tohumans, primate models play a critical role in
        psychopathology research. Specifically,they allow for mechanistic studies of underlying alterations in neural circuitry.
        Primatesdisplay a variety of behaviors when exposed to threatening stimuli, many of whichcontribute to an anxious
        temperament. Of these, a key indicator of an anxiousphenotype is the frequency and quality of vocalizations. In a large
        sample ofpreadolescent monkeys, we hope to build and train an unsupervised ML algorithm thatcan detect and differentiate
        a range of anxiety-related vocal events.</p>

        <h3><span id="3"></span>Identifying Active Extravasation on Arteriograms using Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>Interventional radiologists perform angiograms to identify bleeding before embolization. Bleeding on angiograms is
        mimicked by artifacts and can be difficult to recognize. This project pairs experts in interventional radiology with
        experts in computer science and engineering, in order to develop deep learning machine learning tools to identify sites
        of bleeding on angiograms. We use supervised learning trained on a database of labeled images with bleed sites
        identified. We have already used ResNet-152 as the first stage classifier and Faster R-CNN as the second stage object
        detector, and we evaluated images rather than series. We subsequently explored the CNN YOLO with multi-channel
        preprocessing using time-weighted image aggregation and difference image aggregation to infuse temporal information to
        emphasize the sites of bleeding. We propose to use more advanced deep learning models in our next stage of modeling
        development. The first approach will use “attention” to help the object detection model focus on the bleeding region
        that is of interest, an approach used effectively in similar problems. The second approach will use temporal object
        detection neural networks that can extract temporal and spatial relation between bleeding sites automatically. We will
        also explore using machine learning techniques with un-subtracted series, which we suspect will increase our accuracy as
        machine learning techniques are not limited by human contrast perceptual issues and the raw images avoid motion
        artifacts associated with subtraction.</p>

        <h3><span id="3"></span>Application of Machine Learning to CT Characterization of Renal Cell Carcinoma</h3>
        <p>Characterization of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using classical radiomics has shown association with pathologic features.
        This project applies advanced machine-learning analysis or deep learning models to tumor segmentations with pathologic
        data to identify clinically relevant associations. The models will be tested/refined on ex vivo RCC specimens with
        direct radiologic-pathologic correlation. We have data on approximately 150 RCCs and about 300 radiomics features
        (anatomic, texture) from each. This imaging data has previously demonstrated some association with pathologic features
        (e.g. histologic subtype) with basic statistical analysis but we were unable to identify aggressive tumors (nuclear
        grade 3-4, +sarcomatoid features). We have a second group of segmented tumors from a sarcomatoid rich cohort
        (approximately 95 patients, with size matched controls) where we were also unable to identify a consistent imaging
        signature using a classical radiomics approach. These problems may be dramatically improved by application of machine or
        deep-learning-based methods due to their strong ability to learn the hierarchical latent features of complex data in
        high dimensional space. We will explore cluster analysis and Random Forest modeling on the present set of radiomics
        features. Then we will build a deep learning to build a tumor nuclear grade classifier system for CT images. Tumor
        nuclear grade consists of discrete values 1,2,3,4 and unknown if not applicable. A similar study has been conducted in
        staging liver fibrosis but no robust demonstration of a deep learning system for classifying tumor nuclear grades in
        renal masses currently exists. We plan to use U-Net architecture to segment the tumor from the input CT images and then
        the segmented tumors will be put into a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to generate the final tumor nuclear grades
        for each tumor. We will also consider attention and CNNs to directly link tumor CT images to nuclear grades.</p>
