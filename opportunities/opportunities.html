      <h1 id="join-aiuw">Join AI@UW!</h1>
<p>We have the following positions available for members to choose from. Feel free to post any questions to our Slack channel, #fyi-help, if you can’t find your question on our Q&amp;A page.</p>

<h2 id="engineering-manager">Engineering Manager</h2>
<p>Run your own engineering team to build the project of your dreams. Choose a project category from the two options below (Applied AI or Intelligence Engineering), and email us your project proposal today at aiclubuwmadison@gmail.com!</p>
<h4 id="applied-ai">Applied AI</h4>
<p>Applied AI projects are projects that generally use AI/ML tools as a means to an end.</p>
<h4 id="intelligence-engineering">Intelligence Engineering</h4>
<p>This role is for engineering managers working at the intersection of two or more of the following fields: psychology, neuroscience and artificial intelligence. More generally, the role is meant for students who are more interested in reverse engineering the algorithms of intelligence than simply applying AI/ML algorithms. History shows that this type of role is vital to the advancement of artificial intelligence (Hassabis et al. 2017; Marblestone et al. 2016), but it often gets overlooked during the hype era of deep learning. Example projects might involve comparing &amp; contrasting AI/ML algorithms with human strategies of learning, investigating where brains and modern AI/ML algorithms/architectures diverge (converge), or postulating how to improve the field with novel biologically-inspired architectures and learning principles.</p>

<h2 id="study-group-leader">Study Group Leader</h2>
<p>Want to study an AI/ML related topic more in-depth with others who share your interests? Email us a study group suggestion at aiclubuwmadison@gmail.com for permission to start your own group. This is a great opportunity if you want to work through a particular coursera course, start a paper-discussion group, or just find others interested in learning more about a specific research topic.</p>

<h2 id="associate-executive">Associate Executive</h2>
<p>Join the executive board, prove yourself and become a full-time executive.</p>

<h2 id="software-engineer">Software Engineer</h2>
<p>Join an engineering team to work on an epic AI project.</p>

<h2 id="student">Student</h2>
<p>Join a study-group team to learn more about a specific AI/ML topic.</p>

<h2 id="mentor">Mentor</h2>
<p>You’re a person with AI expertise and want to pass the baton forward. Mentors are expected to contribute a tutorial/workshop talk to the club’s seminar series.</p>
