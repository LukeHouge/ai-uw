<h2 id="algorithmic-trading-team">Algorithmic Trading Team</h2>
<p>We (18 members and growing!) are an engineering team applying multivariate time-series and markov-based modeling approaches to predict stock market trends. Anyone who wants to learn more about and apply these models (including deep learning and reinforcement learning implementations) is welcome to join so long as they have some background coding experience. The Slack channel for this team will soon be made private, so message the team leader–Chris Endemann–on Slack to request to join the team!</p>

<strong>Group Leader:</strong> Chris Endemann<br />
<strong>Contact:</strong> @Chris Endemann (Slack), endemann@wisc.edu</p>

<h2 id="kaggle-team">Kaggle Team</h2>
<p>Engineering team competing on Kaggle, an open platform for data science challenges. Workshops are held every weekend. Anyone who would like to challenge and improve their skills in real-world data science problems are welcomed to join us!</p>

<h2 id="learning-source-code-team">Learning Source Code Team</h2>
<p>Engineering team applying deep learning methods to source code related tasks. We will be focusing on predicting next revision by viewing code as a 2-D image. We are open to other tasks or ideas. Practical knowledge about neural networks, code analysis and programming language is preferred. Python will be mostly used for development. Please join us if you are interested in deep learning for code!</p>

<h2 id="generalized-data-mining-of-science-journals-team">Generalized Data Mining of Science Journals Team</h2>
<p>This engineering team is dedicated to data mining science journals (including images and figures) to distill vast data to a more simplified human understandable data-set/outline of accepted scientific facts based on a search query.</p>

<h2 id="universal-makeup">Universal Makeup</h2>
<p>The makeup industry is booming every day, and the market keeps getting bigger and bigger. In the 21st century, we see that makeup has not just confined itself in its stereotypical ways of stating that it is only for women. Makeup has broadened its spectrum and is being used by everyone in the world, despite their gender and their financial background. It can be hard sometimes to find a foundation that matches one’s skin color exactly, taking into factor their undertone, and skin type. Sometimes, some individuals like myself (who is more olive/tan toned) need to buy two foundations to match my exact skin tone. I want to create something using visual/image technology to create universal makeup! If you would be interested, please contact me at karjohnson@wisc.edu.</p>

<h1 id="active-study-groups">Active Study Groups</h1>

<h2 id="tensorflow-learning-group">Tensorflow Learning Group</h2>
<p>Tensorflow was the most widely deep learning framework in 2018. Learn how to use this powerful library to better structure your deep learning projects! We will begin the semester by building simple models in raw tensorflow, and then work up to implementing more complex models using newer API’s later in the semester. Join this group if you are interested in learning more about deep learning or want to gain practical skills related to AI!<br />

<h2 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Study group focusing around Andrew Ng’s machine learning course on Coursera. The course material is completed on an independent basis, but the group meetings provide a space to ask questions and discuss the course insofar as the group has progressed in it. Meetings take place every weekend; the Slack channel will contain details about the time and location.</p>

<h2 id="neuro-inspired-artificial-general-intelligence">Neuro-Inspired Artificial General Intelligence</h2>
<p>The most exciting advancements in A.I. have been consistently inspired by biology. Therefore, it’s not too crazy to suggest that studying the brain might be the best hope we have of constraining new algorithms that come closer to approaching artificial general intelligence. To follow this premise, this study group’s intent is to discuss the intersections between the fields of cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence, as well as discuss what it means to achieve artificial general intelligence. We will primarily focus our learning materials on research papers, and are always looking for additional members willing to present papers throughout the semester (we are willing to suggest some options).</p>

<p>A few concrete subtopics we’d like to touch on throughout the semester(s)…</p>
<ul>
  <li>Origin and evolution of deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms</li>
  <li>Theories and evidence regarding how the brain updates its feature maps over time</li>
  <li>How plastic is the neocortex at each level of the cortical hierarchy?</li>
  <li>Does backprop occur in the brain? What biologically plausible alternatives to backprop exist?</li>
  <li>How can theoretical neuroscience help reveal mechanisms/algorithms of AGI?</li>
  <li>What key components are lacking from AI these days that prevent us from achieving AGI (e.g. how is the brain different from a DQN algorithm)?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>
<p>Experience with deep learning, reinforcement learning, and/or neuroscience is recommended. Alternatively, for a brief introduction to the field, students can consider working through this computational neuroscience coursera <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience#syllabus">course</a>.</p>
